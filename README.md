## Setup

1. Copy `PSP` folder to the root of you memory stick
2. Run on your PSP, whether it be OFW or CFW.



## Known Bugs
* Sometimes the PSP will just freeze up, nothing to worry though. You can run it again and should be fine.
I seem to have gotten this down to happen more rarely but can still occationally occur.
